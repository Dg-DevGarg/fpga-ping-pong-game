Welcome to the **FPGA Ping Pong Game**! This project implements a classic ping pong game on an FPGA using Verilog. The game features both **single-player** and **multiplayer** modes and is designed to run on an FPGA development board particularly the nexys a-7 100T in this case.

## Features
- **Single-player mode**: Practice mode where you play against a stationary wall.
- **Multiplayer mode**: Two players can compete against each other.
- Smooth paddle and ball movement.
- Score display functionality.
